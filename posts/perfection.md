# Perfection

My pursuit of growth has recently gotten out of hand. My desire to be better than my past self unconsciously created a dangerously increasing standard for the things I do. I now lament that my own hunger pulled me to chase a non-existent perfection. Moreover, this thinking has bled into more than just the work I do - it has fabricated a distaste for my everyday actions. Ironically, I have become my growth's largest deterrent.
