# Lost in Thought

Why is called _lost in thought_?

It seems "lost" has a connotation such that it implies an undesirable state.... as if the thinker, dreamer that is _lost in thought_ must be found.

What if they are right where they need to be, in a blissful state of self-immersion... only to be awoken from their sublime journey into what the awakener has deemed as the "real" world.

Oh! How I envy the dreamer, unperturbed and undisturbed by the awakeners, the policers, of lostness. To enjoy the pleasure... no, the luxury of being lost.
