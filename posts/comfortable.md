# Is it a sin to be comfortable?

Sometimes I wonder if I am doing enough in life. Wonder if I am growing enough. If I am taking enough risk.

One of my life mottos is: **“Become comfortable being uncomfortable.”**

For the most part, I think its a pretty good maxim.  But, sometimes I question if the ideal is self harming. Because, when I look at my present state, comfort and inaction become one - I shame myself for being comfortable.

Is it a sin to be comfortable?

Maybe me from 9 months ago would have scoffed at the question and its haphazard attempts at epistemology. Maybe me from 9 months ago would have been disappointed with myself for being comfortable.

Me from a week ago surely would have. Me from a day ago would have. Me from an hour ago did.

What I’m trying to get across is only tangentially related to this. The fact that I am currently disappointed with myself for being comfortable is not the important thing to note. The important thing here is that I recognized I feel this way. I recognized that I had this subconscious thought influencing my emotions, thoughts, and decisions. I recognized a subtle flaw in my emotions.

Me from 9 months ago surely wouldn’t have recognized that.  But, the me of today did.
