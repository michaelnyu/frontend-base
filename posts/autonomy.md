# Three Autonomies

Thoughts from today.  There are three autonomies that we chase in life.  **Financial autonomy**, **happiness autonomy**, and **thought autonomy**.

When we are young, we want to be older because these autonomies gradually increase with age.  Your parents give you more money, you are able to be with more friends, you are able to do more things you want.  These all contribute to your **freedom as a human**.

This process doesn't stop as we age.  Maybe we don't notice it because we've been living with it for so long.  Or maybe because as we grow, the increments in autonomy are much harder to reach.  Thereafter, our subconsciousness shields us by ignoring this never-ending chase.

Pinpointing these three autonomies and the desire to increase them was only apparent after conversation and reflection - reverse engineering my emotions and thoughts.

Right now, I'm at a place where my financial autonomy will grow rapidly, and then quickly taper off.  At this pivotal point am I acutely aware of my inevitable plateau.

I am at a place where I create much of my own happiness, but only because the situation of being in college and having an abundance of friends and living with people provides me a platform to do so.  I am not reaching the full potential of happiness creation.  I fear when the training wheels of my happiness are pulled from underneath me - it will be a fight to continue riding.  A fight for happiness, how ironic.

I am at a place where I regurgitate thought endlessly.  My mind is weak and hungry for profundities so it latches onto any semblance of intelligence.  This is poor.  And disappoints me the most.  I must break free from the chains that bound my own brain.  I must become more than a parrot to my surroundings.

These three autonomies will be easily forgotten, and may never be remembered.  I take the opportunity that I have stumbled upon in uncovering them to make my life wealthier, happier, and more thoughtful.  I take the opportunity to become more  myself.
